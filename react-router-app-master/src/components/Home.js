  Now we want our Home content to fetch some data from the third party API.
          Example: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
  To do that we need to have axios --> axios is a HTTP client which helps to fetch data from API's.
          --> We import the axios library from the npm : npm install axios
          --> Now we have the axios installed so we can now go and fetch data from the API.
          --> How do we do that:
                # Since we have lifecycle hooks of a component, we discussed that a good point to load external data to the
                  component is componentDidMount() --> when component is already mounted on the DOM.
                # So we will use axios inside componentDidMount() to get the data from the API.
                # To use lifecycle hooks we need to convert this component to a class based component:
                          Why class based?
                          Because we can't use lifecycle hooks inside functional component

                        const Home = () => {
                          return(

    // We will first import axios and then make a get request because we want to get data.
    // We can use post if want to post but for this application we just want to get data

    // The get() request is asynchronous i.e it will take sometime to go and fetch the data from API.
    // So it returns a promise.
    // Promise means that this request will return at somepoint and time.
    // So we use .then() method.
    // Any code inside .then() method only triggers when the get request is completed.

    axios.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts')
    // .then() on completion fires back a callback function and that function has the response object.
    // we can check the response object by logging it in the console.
    // we have a property called data inside the response object.
    // we can grab that res.data to get all the data and output it.
    // To output this data in this Home content we need to have a state which will contains the posts.
